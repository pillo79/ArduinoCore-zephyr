# This script checks a completed CI workflow run and re-runs its failed jobs
# if any of them failed because of an infrastructure issue, such as a network
# timeout while transferring the build environment.
#
# A failed job is considered an infrastructure failure if all its failed steps
# are in the INFRA_STEPS list below, or if it failed without any failed step
# (lost runner, setup error). The failed jobs are re-run if at least one of
# them is an infrastructure failure: the other failures are usually caused by
# the same issue, and real errors will just fail again.
#
# The failed jobs are not re-run if:
#  - the run is not completed, or already reached MAX_ATTEMPTS attempts;
#  - a board build must be re-run, but the build environment it needs has
#    expired (only re-running all jobs can work then);
#  - the run is outdated: the pull request or branch it tested has changed.
#
# Expects the GH_TOKEN, GITHUB_REPOSITORY and RUN_ID environment variables.
# RUN_ATTEMPT selects the attempt to check (default: the latest one).
# If DRY_RUN is set, the decision is printed but no job is re-run.
#
# Usage: ci_rerun_infra_failures.sh
