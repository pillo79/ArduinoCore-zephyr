/*
  Nano 33 BLE Microphone to Serial Streamer

  Circuit:
  - Arduino Nano 33 BLE board

  How to use this example:

  1. Upload this sketch to the board. Microphone acquisition starts
     immediately and raw audio samples are streamed over the serial port.

  2. Make sure no serial monitor or other program is keeping the serial
     port open.

  3. Run the host script provided in the library extras folder:
       extras/PDMSerialAudioRecorder/PDMSerialAudioRecorder.py
     It reads the samples streamed by this sketch and packs them into a
     WAV file you can play back on your PC.

  Notes:

  - The host script uses /dev/ttyACM0 as the default serial device; change
    it if your board enumerates as a different device.
  - The host script records about 5 seconds of audio.
